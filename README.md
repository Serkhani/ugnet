## Motivation 🤔

It is quite difficult to get around college with all your tasks written somewhere, announcements coming from gmail and random whatsapp groups(usually created by students to prevent missing the memo)...

... but what if we can get all in one app?🤔

5. Enjoy 😎

## Ways to improve 📈

In its current state, this application does exactly what it needs to do. However, lots of improvements can be made:
  # Frontend

    [x] Showing the user's task(s)
    [x] Showing announcements
    [x] Displaying the user's tasks
    [x] Adding a means to display school websites in the app
    [x] Adding a chat ui
    [x] Adding newsfeed page
    [x] Adding a page to get user feedback
  # Backend

    [ ] Adding user auth
    [ ] Adding chat logic
    [x] Adding a means to upload files
    [ ] Adding a means to save files to the internal memory

## Things I learnt
- How to make use of various dependencies namely:
  * hidden_drawer_menu
  * flutter_chat_ui
- Creating a webview in app
- Using the `Search Delegate` in flutter
